Linear Regression Projects

This folder contains two small projects I worked on while learning the basics of Linear Regression. Both are simple experiments to understand how the model behaves on different datasets and how to evaluate predictions using metrics like MSE and R².

1. Boston Housing

This script uses the California Housing dataset from sklearn.
I loaded the data, explored its structure, converted it into a DataFrame and trained a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
The main goal was to practise preprocessing, splitting the data and checking model performance using MSE and R².

2. Student Marks Prediction

This project uses a CSV file containing study hours and marks scored by students.
I built a Linear Regression model to predict marks based on the hours studied and number of courses.
After training, I plotted Actual vs Predicted values to understand how well the model fits.
This was a simple task, but it helped me relate the concept to a real life example.

What I learned

Working on these two small datasets helped me understand
how Linear Regression works, how to measure model performance
and how preprocessing affects the final results.
These are basic projects but they gave me confidence to move on
to other ML algorithms.
