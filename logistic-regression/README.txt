Logistic Regression Projects

This folder contains two small projects I worked on while learning how Logistic Regression is used for binary classification. Both datasets are different, so they helped me understand how preprocessing changes from one problem to another.

1. Weather Forecast (Rain Prediction)

This project predicts whether it will rain or not based on weather conditions.
The dataset had a column with text labels like "rain" and "no rain", so I mapped them to 1 and 0.
After splitting the data, I trained a Logistic Regression model and checked the performance using accuracy, confusion matrix and a classification report.
It is a simple project, but it helped me understand how classification works on clean and small datasets.

2. Loan Approval Prediction

This dataset had several categorical features such as gender, education and loan intent.
I used one-hot encoding to convert these into numerical columns.
Then I trained a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a loan should be approved or not.
This project gave me a clearer idea of how much preprocessing is required before the model can learn anything meaningful.
The evaluation was also done using accuracy, confusion matrix and the classification report.

What I learned

Working on these two tasks made me comfortable with
cleaning data, encoding categorical features, splitting the data
and evaluating classification results.
Both projects are basic, but they helped me build a foundation
before moving toward more advanced models.
